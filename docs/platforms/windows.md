# What is it ?

ThinLine Radio is an open source software that ingest and distribute audio files generated by various software-defined radio recorders. Its interface tries to reproduce the user experience of a real police scanner, while adding its own touch.

> **Note:** ThinLine Radio is based on [Rdio Scanner](https://github.com/chuot/rdio-scanner) by Chrystian Huot.

You can listen to ThinLine Radio on any modern browsers using the integrated web app.

# Recorders compatibility

ThinLine Radio works with any radio recorder, as long as they can create audio files separated by conversations or transmissions.

Here is a list of recorders known to work with ThinLine Radio:

| Recorder                                                       | API | Dirwatch |

1. Make sure you have the latest version of ThinLine Radio.

2. Extract the contents of the archive somewhere on your computer. The configuration file and the database file will be created in this same folder.

        C:\Users\user> mkdir thinline-radio

        C:\Users\user> cd thinline-radio

        C:\Users\user\thinline-radio> tar -xvf ^
            ..\downloads\thinline-radio-windows-amd64-v7.0.0.zip
        x thinline-radio.exe
        x thinline-radio.pdf

3. Run the executable.

        C:\Users\user\thinline-radio>thinline-radio

# Advanced customizations

## Listening on an alternate port

Here we want our ThinLine Radio instance to listen for connections on the standard HTTP port.

        C:\Users\user\thinline-radio>thinline-radio -listen :80
        
        ThinLine Radio v7.0.0
        ----------------------------------
        2022/12/19 10:53:31 server started

## Exposing ThinLine Radio with Cloudflare Tunnels

It is recommended to share your ThinLine Radio instance over the internet using Cloudflare Tunnels. This is a simple and secure solution that works on any system without requiring port forwarding or SSL certificate management.

### Prerequisites

1. A domain name (you can register one at Cloudflare or transfer an existing domain)
2. A Cloudflare account (free tier works perfectly)

### Step 1: Get or Transfer Your Domain

1. **If you don't have a domain:**
   - Go to [Cloudflare](https://www.cloudflare.com/) and sign up for a free account
   - Navigate to "Add a Site" and register a new domain

2. **If you already have a domain:**
   - Log into your Cloudflare account
   - Click "Add a Site" and enter your domain
   - Follow the instructions to transfer your domain's nameservers to Cloudflare
   - Update your domain registrar with Cloudflare's nameservers (provided during setup)

### Step 2: Create Tunnel in Cloudflare Dashboard

1. Log into your [Cloudflare Dashboard](https://dash.cloudflare.com/)
2. Select your domain
3. Go to **Zero Trust** → **Networks** → **Tunnels**
4. Click **Create a tunnel**
5. Select **Cloudflared** as the connector
6. Give your tunnel a name (e.g., "thinline-radio")
7. Click **Save tunnel**

### Step 3: Configure Public Hostname

1. In the tunnel configuration page, click **Configure** under your tunnel
2. Go to the **Public Hostnames** tab
3. Click **Add a public hostname**
4. Configure:
   - **Subdomain**: `radio` (or your desired subdomain)
   - **Domain**: Select your domain
   - **Service**: `http://localhost:3000`
5. Click **Save hostname**

The DNS record will be automatically created by Cloudflare.

### Step 4: Install Cloudflare Tunnel Connector

Download `cloudflared` from [Cloudflare releases](https://github.com/cloudflare/cloudflared/releases) and extract it to a folder (e.g., `C:\cloudflared`).

### Step 5: Run the Connector

From the Cloudflare dashboard tunnel page, copy the command shown under "Run a connector". It will look like:

```cmd
cloudflared tunnel run <tunnel-name>
```

**As a Windows Service (recommended):**

1. Open Command Prompt as Administrator
2. Navigate to the cloudflared directory
3. Install as a service:
```cmd
cloudflared service install
```
4. Run the tunnel command from the dashboard
5. Start the service:
```cmd
net start cloudflared
```

**Manual run (for testing):**
Run the command copied from the Cloudflare dashboard in a Command Prompt window.

### Step 6: Access Your Server

Once the connector is running, access ThinLine Radio at `https://radio.yourdomain.com` (or your configured subdomain). The connection is automatically encrypted with SSL/TLS provided by Cloudflare.

### Benefits of Cloudflare Tunnels

- **No port forwarding required** - Your server can be behind any firewall
- **Automatic SSL/TLS** - Cloudflare handles all certificates
- **DDoS protection** - Built-in Cloudflare protection
- **Works anywhere** - Behind NAT, VPN, or any network configuration
- **Free** - No cost for basic tunnel usage

## Save your advanced configuration to a config file

You don't want to have to type everytime a long list of arguments. No problem, you can save your advanced configuration to a file by adding the **-config_save** argument.

        C:\Users\user\thinline-radio>thinline-radio ^
            -listen :80                         ^
            -ssl_auto_cert mydomain.com         ^
            -ssl_listen :443                    ^
            -config_save
        2022/12/19 11:08:28 thinline-radio.ini file created

All of your parameters passed as arguments to ThinLine Radio have been saved to an INI file which has the same arguments/values list.

        db_file = thinline-radio.db
        db_type = postgresql
        db_host = localhost
        db_port = 5432
        db_name = thinline_radio
        db_user = thinline_user
        db_pass = your_password
        listen = :80
        ssl_auto_cert = mydomain.com
        ssl_listen = :443

> **Note:** SQLite is no longer supported in version 7. You must use PostgreSQL or MySQL/MariaDB. See the [update guide](../update-from-v6.md) for migration instructions.

Then simply run ThinLine Radio without any arguments.

        C:\Users\user\thinline-radio>thinline-radio
        
        ThinLine Radio v7.0.0
        ----------------------------------

## Install ThinLine Radio as a service

Everything looks ok now, but you do not want to manualy start ThinLine Radio after every reboot. No problem, you can install your server instance as a service. **Note that you will be required to proceed in a command prompt that is running as Administrator**.

        C:\Users\user\thinline-radio>thinline-radio -service install
        
        C:\Users\user\thinline-radio>thinline-radio -service start
