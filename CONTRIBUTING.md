# Guidelines for contributing to ThinLine Radio

Please follow these simple guidelines to contribute to ThinLine Radio. Discuss the change first through [GitHub Discussions](https://github.com/Thinline-Dynamic-Solutions/ThinLineRadio/discussions), email, or any other method with the project maintainers.

## Support requests or general questions

Support requests or general questions are welcome on the [GitHub Discussions](https://github.com/Thinline-Dynamic-Solutions/ThinLineRadio/discussions). Do not create an issue for this, it will be rejected and closed immediately.

For all ThinLine Radio support, please contact ThinLine Dynamic Solutions support.

## Bugs and feature requests

We use [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/Thinline-Dynamic-Solutions/ThinLineRadio/issues) to track bugs and feature requests.

Open an [issue](https://github.com/Thinline-Dynamic-Solutions/ThinLineRadio/issues) that best describes the bug or feature request.

For **bugs**, describe the environment in which you encounter it and explain step by step how to reproduce them.

For **feature requests**, describe the reason and use case.

Most of the time, the issue will be assigned to the project maintainers and then resolved in a timely manner. In some cases, the issue will be identified as _help needed_ and then assigned to a volunteer contributor. Again, pull requests will be rejected if they are not related to a previously opened and assigned issue.

## Random Pull Requests

To keep the project stable and well organized, random pull requests will be rejected if no issue have been previously opened and assigned first by the project maintainers.
